Javascript Form Validation Project:
Introduction:
Forms are an integral part of our Website. We need to verify all the details so we know
the person filling the form is Human and not a Bot.
 I Created a Form with following fields and check if each fields have relevant data in it.
Required Fields:
 Full Name, Email ID, Phone Number, Password and Confirm Password
Validation Criteria:
 Name must not be less than 5 characters
 Email Id should have @ character in it
 Phone Number should not be 123456789 and must be a 10-digit number.
 Password cannot be ‘password’ or ‘name of the user’ or less than 8 characters.
 Password and confirm password should match
 Whenever any of the above are not met, the error should pop saying ex; “enter
correct email” or “password is not strong” etc
 You can include more conditions and fields to the form validation but the above
are mandatory.
Development tools:
 HTML
 CSS and Bootstrap
 JavaScript( Event listeners(onSubmit and onChange), multiple functions, loops,
if/else )
